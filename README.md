- `AppShortcutsProvider` for Siri phrase registration
- `SiriTipView` components for user discoverability

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cooking-timer.git
```

2. Open in Xcode
```bash
cd cooking-timer
open "Cooking Timer.xcodeproj"
```

3. Build and run on your device or simulator

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Simple Meal
Perfect for straightforward cooking:
- **Pasta**: 12 minutes (Start with meal)
- **Sauce**: 8 minutes (Start with meal)

### Complex Meal with Sequencing
For advanced coordination:
- **Pre-heat oven**: 10 minutes (Start with meal)
- **Chicken**: 45 minutes (Start when oven pre-heat completes)
- **Vegetables**: 20 minutes (Start 25 minutes after chicken starts)
- **Bread**: 5 minutes (Start 40 minutes after chicken starts)

Everything finishes at the same time!

### Using Siri
Voice commands for hands-free cooking:
- **"Hey Siri, start cooking Pasta Dinner in Cooking Timer"**
- **"Hey Siri, list my meals in Cooking Timer"**
- **"Hey Siri, show my meals in Cooking Timer"**

App Shortcuts also appear in:
- Spotlight search
- Shortcuts app
- Siri suggestions

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This app embraces Apple's design principles:
- **Clarity**: Clean, focused interface with clear visual hierarchy
- **Deference**: Content-first design with beautiful but unobtrusive UI
- **Depth**: Layers, shadows, and depth create realistic connections

The stove burner metaphor provides an intuitive, skeuomorphic interface that makes timer status immediately apparent.
